    <h1>Very Good Humor</h1>
     <p>by Jony Castillo</p>
     <p>I have been consuming media for a long time so I hope there are some decently funny things I've come across in that time.
     </p>
     <h2>Forces You to Laugh</h2>
      <p>I orginally saw this video in a psychology class while talking about the science of contagious laughter. The video still makes me laugh to this day.

     <h2>THE MACHINE!</h2>
      <p>I enjoy stand up comedy and have seen many stand up specials. In comedy one of the most famous jokes is Bert Kreischer's The Machine Story. It is defintely worth a listen.

     <h2>CoryxKenshin</h2>
      <p>This is one is defintely more of a personal taste of comedy, but youtuber @CoryxKenshin is my favorite so I'm just going too link one of his most viewed videos.
