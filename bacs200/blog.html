				<h1>Social Media and Extremism</h1>
				<p>Over the last two decades, the internet has taken off exponentially only becoming more and more popular. Within just the last decade, the explosion of social media has made communication between strangers (especially with anonymity) sky rocket. We have seen people's stances on politics become more aggresive and extreme. Allowing anonymous arguement has seemed to polarize people more than ever before.</p>

					<h2>Social Implications</h2>
					<p>In current social media culture, civil debate is almost never the first path taken when disagreements between users take place. It is very much who can be more the louder, more insulting person. I believe this leads to serious implications as a culture about how we deal with conflict in our lives. It is important to check ourselves in how we analyze arguments we see take place and question our personal train of thought when we are in a disagreement with someone.</p>
